The demand from 2023 to 2033 will be influenced by several key factors:</p><ul>    <li><strong>Expansion in Plant-Based Products:</strong> As more consumers shift to plant-based diets, citrus powders will play an essential role in flavoring plant-based foods like vegan snacks and dairy alternatives.</li>    <li><strong>Product Innovation:</strong> Manufacturers are likely to develop new, innovative citrus powder formulations.

In North America and Europe, health-conscious consumers will drive growth in both the food and nutraceutical sectors. In Asia-Pacific, the growing middle class and rising interest in health supplements will be key growth drivers. Emerging markets in Latin America and the Middle East will also contribute significantly to the market’s expansion, with the increasing popularity of functional foods and beverages.</p><h2>Market Challenges and Opportunities</h2><p>While the citrus powder market presents numerous opportunities, it also faces certain challenges. These include the volatility in citrus fruit supply due to climate change and the high costs of quality production.
