The primary drivers of this demand include:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Environmental sustainability</strong>: Consumers and manufacturers alike are increasingly prioritizing natural, sustainable ingredients, positioning Stevia as an attractive alternative to synthetic sweeteners.</li>  <li><strong>Increased use in plant-based foods</strong>: The rise of plant-based diets, alongside the demand for sugar substitutes, is expected to drive the use of Stevia in plant-based beverages and snacks.</li>  <li><strong>Advancements in extraction technology</strong>: More efficient extraction methods are expected to lower production costs, making Stevia more accessible to small and medium-sized businesses.</li>  <li><strong>Rising awareness of diabetes and obesity</strong>: With the global prevalence of diabetes and obesity on the rise, there will be an increased shift toward healthier alternatives like Stevia.</li></ul><h2>Key Regional Markets</h2><p>Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region (particularly China and India) has been a major supplier of Stevia, while North America and Europe have been key consumers.
